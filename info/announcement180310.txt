A new library `gwoptics' for plotting in 2D or 3D is available here:

http://www.gwoptics.org/processing/gwoptics_p5lib/

With this library it should be easy to create simple line 
graphs of static or dynamic data in 2D. You can also plot 
functions or data in 3D, for example, using some nice 
colourmaps.

We started to use Processing last year in our research 
group for doing simple simulations related to optics. So far
this has been a very successful and fun exercise. The most 
common need was for a library that simplifies the plotting
of functions or data. Therefore one of my students, 
Daniel Brown, has developed this library. You can see it in
action here:
