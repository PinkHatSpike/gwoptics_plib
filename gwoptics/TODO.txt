TODO items:

For Processing 2.0

- everything will be OpenGL which requires some changes
  SquareMesh example shows that lines work differently
  now. Is not looking good now, but don't know what's
  the problem.

- PGraphics2D and 3D have disappeared
  the latter is PGraphicsOpenGL
  the former maybe PGraphics???

- all the Blank2DCanvas things seem to fail
  because they cannot see/find PGraphics2D,
  might be a Processing bug in 2.05a

For Android

- Most basic examples fail on Axis draw, might be a font problem?

- RollingGraph fails:
  Timer class seems not to work well with Anroid,
  see
  e.g. http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/timed-ui-updates.html
  or maybe a too simple version:
  http://www.mopri.de/?p=1438

- all 3D examples fail because the camera is looking for mouse events

- probably need to change the hardcoded font to
  something smarter, at least add a setFont method


Other stuff

- mathutils.mathUtils.java should be renamed mathutils.MathUtils
  currently only used in the GWBinary sketch
